The artist invited writers and playwrights to compose texts from the point of view of the individuals portrayed in the album and had those texts spoken by actors.</p>

                popUpContent: <p>Ascent is a reflection on this mountain that has such great significance to the Japanese, but also a study of its visual culture and a tribute to the history of both photography and film. Tan combined the images with a fictional narrative, which causes the distinction between still and moving images to shift. She thereby reveals a unique realm in which photography and film come together and interrelate. The story, resounding with the climb to the top of the mountain, alternates between narration and history, from Western imperialism to modern tourism, from the early days of photography to the present day. </p>

Confused and with nothing to hang on to, he breaks out of his helpless state by taking a drastic decision. He leaves home and sets off on a curious odyssey. Guided by confrontational, tragicomic and hopeful meetings, he struggles to get to grips with himself and the future.</p>
